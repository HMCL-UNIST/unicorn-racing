## Tire type characteristics

When looking for racing tires, touring (GT) or rally tires often provide strong grip on **smooth surfaces** such as Roboracer tracks.

We used Stradale Mega Soft tires, which performed well both on smooth floors (auditorium or marble) and on surfaces with rugs or mats.

- The softer the compound (Mega Soft), the stronger the grip but the faster the wear.
- The harder the compound (Firm), the slower the wear but the lower the grip.

Therefore, **Firm tires** are better for asphalt-like conditions, while **Mega Soft tires** are better for smooth indoor surfaces such as auditorium or marble floors.

## Factors that affect grip

Grip depends not only on tire type but also on **temperature and humidity**.

- **MEGA SOFT**: below 0℃ or below 20℃
- **SUPER SOFT**: 15℃ to below 25℃
- **SOFT**: 20℃ to below 35℃
- **MEDIUM**: 30℃ to below 45℃, or ultra-high-grip surfaces
- **FIRM**: high-temperature or ultra-high-grip surfaces

In general, **higher humidity** increases grip and reduces slipping, while **dry conditions** reduce grip and increase slipping.

## Wrap-up

Tire choice depends heavily on surface and temperature/humidity. Softer compounds work best on smooth surfaces, while harder compounds are more suitable for hot or rough conditions. Choose the compound based on the actual environment to achieve stable performance.
