When replacing tires on an RC vehicle, the wheel hub hex size may not match. This post introduces how to use a hub adapter to mount 17mm hex tires on a 12mm hex vehicle.

## Hex Size Differences

Traxxas vehicles use a **12mm hex** for tire mounting by default, while SRX vehicles use a **17mm hex**.

Generally, **1/10 scale** RC vehicles use 12mm hex, and **1/8 scale** vehicles use 17mm hex.

As shown in the images, some tires have the hex size labeled while others do not, so keep this in mind when purchasing tires.

## Using a Hub Adapter

If you want to use 17mm hex tires but your vehicle (like Traxxas) has a 12mm hex wheel mount, you can **install a hub adapter to solve the problem.**
